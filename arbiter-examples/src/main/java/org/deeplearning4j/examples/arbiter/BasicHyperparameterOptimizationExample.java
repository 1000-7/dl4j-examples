/**
 * This is a basic hyperparameter optimization example using Arbiter to conduct random search on two network hyperparameters.
 * The two hyperparameters are learning rate and layer size, and the search is conducted for a simple multi-layer perceptron
 * on MNIST data.
 *
 * Note that this example has a UI, but it (currently) does not start automatically.
 * By default, the UI is accessible at http://localhost:8080/arbiter
